    "### Proposal \n",
    "I happened upon what appears to be a robust dataset of board game reviews along with additional data on board games that is available from boardgamegeek.com via API. Based on the review data and additional game attributes available via the API, I am hoping to create a recommender system by loading this information into a tree and asking the user a few questions in order to pull up the best game for them to play based on the crowdsourced ratings. I am interested to see how I can refine this plan once I've had a bit more time exploring the data available via the API. At first glance, the API includes some interesting parameters that allow you to access videos about the game, as well as details on users, forums, and threads. I also located a large dataset of Board Game attributes via Kaggle, which I hope to use to enhance the ability for the user to query based on more than just ratings. This dataset includes play time, age range, as well as # of players. I am hoping to combine these various datasets to ultimately create my board game recommender tree. "
