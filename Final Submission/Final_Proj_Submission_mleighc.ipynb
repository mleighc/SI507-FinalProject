    "First, I began by accessing about 20k board game records from a combination of xml data accessed via Board Game Geek's (BGG) API, along with a Kaggle csv of additional board game attribute data scraped from BGG by another user. Using the xmltodict package, I was able to parse the xml data and save it to a python dictionary. From there, I enhanced the dictionary objects with additional board game attributes from the Kaggle csv and saved a selected subset of the records (about 500) to a json file.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting a better understanding of the data, I was able to think through various methods of categorizing the data (i.e. solo vs. multiplayer games, short vs. long play time, family vs. party games, etc.) in order to create a tree of questions to be asked of the user. These user questions would allow the computer to filter through the subset of the ~20k board game objects and recommend the right list for the user. From there, the user can access details from individual records to make their final selection. I used a subset of data for ease of processing on my limited computer memory, but I believe a larger subset could be worked through and loaded, as well as the addition of more subquestions to shorten the result lists that are returned."

    "The board game data, along with a series of categorical (this or that, yes or no) questions, were saved into a tree structure. The tree is formatted as triples or tuples of 3 tuples.

The \"filtered\" results are stored as a list of dictionaries and saved in the last leaf of each subTree to be accessed by the _display_list_ and _pick_game_ functions.     \n",

From there, they continue to answer a series of questions until the final Result Leaf is reached and a final filtered list of game dictionaries is pretty printed to the screen with its `ID` and `Name`. The user is asked to select one of the games by its `ID` in order to view the game's description, as well as access its cover image url in a web browser. Once that information is displayed to the user, they are prompted to decide whether they'd like to view the details of another game or `Exit` the program.        \n",
